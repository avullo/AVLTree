AVLTree - Efficient AVL Balanced Binary Trees in Perl

Perl extension for efficient creation and manipulation of AVL balanced binary trees.

AVLTree provides a simple and fast implementation of AVL balanced trees.
It uses the Perl XS extension mechanism by providing a tiny wrapper around
an efficient C library which does the core of the work. Preliminary benchmarking
shows this module is one order of magnitude faster than a pure perl implementation.

The nodes of an AVL tree object can hold any kind of item, as long as each 
one of these has an element which can be used to define a partial order on 
the set of possible items. This is specified by providing, upon tree construction,
a reference to a function for comparing any two of the possible items.

The underlying C library is a reinterpretation of the C library originally 
developed by Julienne Walker. This library has been adapted for dealing 
directly with Perl (SV) variables.

The module at the moment is in beta stage but it is usable. It provides methods
for creating and querying an AVL tree, get its size and insert and remove elements
from it. No methods exist to traverse the tree at this stage, but I promise this
functionality is going to be implemented very soon.
